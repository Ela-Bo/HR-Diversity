HR Analytics is catching on, but it’s still a growing area with many companies yet to embrace the opportunities it can offer. Last year I was part of a data science bootcamp and spent some time training myself to e.g. learn python and statistics. I know that HR information is subject to confidentiality, privacy and data protection laws and ethics is something that should always be on your mind. Still I am at the beginning and need to learn a lot more but I am so curious to take a deeper dive into the HR Analytics world. That's why I spent some time reading articles and tried to find out more about diversity and inclusion and how HR analytics can be part of it. 

# Diversity and Inclusion

Diverse teams with engaged talents are **more innovative, understand customer needs better, and drive financial results**. On the one hand, a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is important for companies looking to build workplaces that are **representative of the world in which we live**. On the other hand, investments in diversity, equity and inclusion have a well-documented relationship to **business performance** and increased profits. 

Organizations need a comprehensive approach that looks at diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization (and society) as a whole. HR may lead the effort, but this is an **organization-wide undertaking**. Data and analytics should play a key role in this endeavor, providing the ability to **identify where there are gaps, prioritize areas for action, and enable ongoing measurement of progress**.  

- **Diversity**  When we are talking about a diversity of talents (internal diversity), we are talking about the representation of different groups of population in the workforce of an organization.
- **Equity** Equity involves looking at programs, initiatives and individual cases where opportunities may or may not be consistent and fair. This can be characterized by inequities or gaps in pay, promotions, opportunities for development, opportunities to lead, and more. 
- **Inclusion** First of all, it is a feeling. It is subjective and less tangible than diversity. The best talents that don’t feel included will not contribute and won’t’ stay in the organization for a long time.

Diversity and Inclusion is **not a one-time initiative**. In the best case, it becomes a part of the **company’s culture**. So the following indicators should be updated and analyzed periodically. This data is sometimes found in your core systems, like your HRIS or your learning management system, furthermore it’s found in surveys or qualitative data. 

# Steps to setting meaningful diversity and inclusion metrics

- **1. Define which diversity dimensions you will monitor, depending on your business goals**
E.g.if you are seeking to improve retention through the implementation of a flexible work policy you should extend your diversity metrics to track employment status and tenure. 
- **2. Review data policies**
Maybe you need the individual consent to capture sensitive information. So you should consider the legal and ethical requirements regarding the storing of sensitive information. 
- **3. Establish baseline measures**
It is impossible to track progress unless you have a baseline measure. Maybe you can check business or industry benchmarks or set up your own company baseline measure. 
- **4. Assign responsibility and establish accountability**
Ultimate accountability for diversity and inclusion should be at the level of the CEO and the Board of Directors.
- **5. Track and analyse results** 
It's a good idead to set up a formal plan for measuring your progress — what metrics will be calculated, by whom, and how often? 
- **6. Build a Dashboard**  
Visualize your KPIs and create a Human resources KPI template. It includes all the key metrics and presents them visually so that your analysis becomes much simpler.
- **7. Report results and outline new initiatives**
Results of diversity efforts should be transparent internally - of course, not all metrics need to be disclosed.
- **8. Review metrics regularly**
Employers should regularly review diversity and inclusion metrics, changing them as needed as the diversity and inclusion program matures and as business goals change.

# Metrics 

In the follwoing i noted some metrics for your diversity & inclusion analytics which can help you to e.g. identify risk areas, prioritise initiatives, set targets and other program goals. 

### Diversity Numbers (representation in the board, in the leadership, whole organication) 
Useful for identifying groups that are underrepresented in the organisation
- Nationalities / Ethnicity 
- Gender 
- Age
- Educational attainment
- Languages spoken / English proficiency
- Seniority (tenure / professional expertise)
- Disability and health status
- Family status
- Carer and parental status
- Employment status (full time, part-time, flexible working)

### Salary related
- Avg Salary per Gender (Gender Gap)

### Related to D&I Initiatives
- **Number of D&I Initiatives Implemented** = The number of D&I initiatives implemented measures organizational commitment to establishing and maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion
- **Number of D&I Trainings & Participants** = The number of D&I trainings offered and measuring the participamnts can give you insights of your culture of diversity and inclusion

### Related to Recruiting 
Useful for identifying barriers to entry for different groups, pipeline issues, and narrow or biased recruitment efforts or for identifying bias in assessment and selection.
- **Diversity in Recruiting / Talent Pool**
Looking closer on your recruitment activities you can e.g. measure the gender / education / languages / nationalities etc. in your recruitment process / or talent pool. 
- **Number of global hires** = Or you can check the number of how many talents were hired globally 

## 8. Equity 
Equity involves looking at all processes in your business - from hiring, firing, promotions, task assignment, team creation, recognition to other less obvious aspects like how meetings are run and how groups interact. It looks at these processes for bias or inequity - either conscious or unconscious. 


## 8. Employee Inclusion Index
It’s about creating an environment where people feel valued, leveraged and welcome. In an inclusive organization all people are respected and appreciated for their unique contributions.Information about inclusiveness tends to be driven by experience data and surveys which can be purely qualitative in nature but can also exist in a hybrid where qualitative and quantitative data are combined. 

Inclusion is a feeling of:
- Being part of the team
- Being heard
- Being respected and valued
- Having equal political power

It can be measured according to the anonymous employee surveys
